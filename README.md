# quantum-federated-ML
A Python project implementing image classification with a hybrid quantum nerual network
# Abstract
This project outlines a demonstration of federated learning using a hybrid quantum neural net to classify images of planes and cars from the CIFAR10 dataset. The approach used for the neural net is a hybrid, combining a pre-trained ResNet18 neural network with a quantum variational encoder. The project proves the applicability of federated learning for quantum machine learning and argues for its usefulness in the field.
